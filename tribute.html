          <p id="tribute-info">Muhammad Anwar el-Sadat[a] (25 December 1918 – 6 October 1981) was an Egyptian 
            politician
             and military officer who served as the third president of Egypt, from 15 October 1970 until his
             
              assassination by fundamentalist army officers on 6 October 1981. 
              Sadat was a senior member of the Free Officers who overthrew King Farouk in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and a close confidant of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, under whom he served as Vice President twice and whom he succeeded as president in 1970. In 1978, Sadat and Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel, signed a peace treaty in cooperation with United States President Jimmy Carter, for which they were recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize.
            In his eleven years as president, he changed Egypt's trajectory, 
            departing from many of the political and economic tenets of Nasserism, re-instituting a 
            multi-party system, and launching the Infitah economic policy. As President, he led Egypt 
            
            in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to regain Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had occupied 
            since the Six-Day War of 1967, making him a hero in Egypt and, for a time, the wider Arab World. 
            Afterwards, he engaged in negotiations with Israel, culminating in the Egypt–Israel peace treaty; 
            this won him and Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize.
